            <h3>Is this a funding company or a software tool?</h3>
            <p>
              BizCredit OS is a software operating system focused on structure, tracking, and guidance. 
              It’s designed to support your funding strategy, not to replace lenders or underwriters.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you guarantee I’ll get business credit without a personal guarantee?</h3>
            <p>
              No. We don’t make funding guarantees. We help you build a stronger, more credible profile 
              over time—so when you apply, you’re not guessing what lenders are looking at.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I use this if I’m just forming my LLC?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. In fact, “day zero” entities are ideal. You can build correctly from the beginning 
              instead of cleaning up later.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will you tell me exactly which banks or vendors to use?</h3>
            <p>
              BizCredit OS can help you think in terms of relationships and reporting, but specific 
              institutions, offers, and approvals will always depend on your location, industry, and risk profile.
